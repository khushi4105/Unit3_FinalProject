# Unit3_FinalProject
My final project for Creative Coding I is called <i>"Sandy Words"</i>. It is an art & text-based game in which the user has freedom to produce multiple text extracts. They also have to option to enable an automated-voice to recite the text at the speed in which it is being produced. The background is simply present to create a relaxing ambience while the user can listen to their Sandy Words that are produced.

<h2>#Interaction</h2>
<ul>
 My program is very interactive. I will include various coding data types to help create the following in my program:
 <li>The text is produced while the mouse is moving</li>
 <li>The size of the text depends on the speed of the mouse</li>
 <li>If the "SPACE" key is pressed, the font, size & the text itself change using a random generator</li>
 <li>If the "B" key is pressed, the abstract SAND background re-starts from the top</li>
 <li>The music in the background is present for a sense of relaxation</li>
 </ul>
