# Unit3_FinalProject
My final project for Creative Coding I is called <i>"Sandy Words"</i>. It is an art & text-based game in which the user has freedom to produce multiple text extracts. They also have to option to enable an automated-voice to recite the text at the speed in which it is being produced. The background is simply present to create a relaxing ambience while the user can listen to their extract.
