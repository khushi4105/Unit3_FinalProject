# Unit3_FinalProject
My final project for Creative Coding I is called <i>"Text Art"</i>. It is a Box-2D based game in which the user has freedom to produce text based on the speed of their mouse Simultaneously, a heap of sand is falling down and piling up.

<h2>#Interaction</h2>
<ul>
 My program is interactive. I will include various coding data types to help create the following in my program:
 <li>The sand will re-start to pile when the key "A" is pressed</li>
